## Custom Agents

You can create a "custom agent" where you select a model give it a name and give it a system prompt.

## Advanced mode

Maybe have modes in the settings or when you first start the app to control the amount of UI that would be shown. This is good for people who know nothing about AI and want to use the app for simple stuff that doesn't require a fine grained choice of model.
